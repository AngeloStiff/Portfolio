                              My mom and day named me after the word angel because they believed that I'm the angel to their life. I spent my whole life in the City of Pines where it had inspire and motivated me, from the attitude of every people to the culture, to be proud of where I'm from. From my early days until now, I have learned to appreciate the little things that I have and be in touch with the news all over the world. Growing up, I usually spend playing around inside our home and seldom do I go out to play with my friends back then. I used to watch cartoons from morning until late night which made me late everytime I go to school. Because of my upbringing, in which I was always at home, I became fascinated with computers and cellphones. That's when I realized that I wan to have a job related to information technology.Overall, I had a tough upbringing because I went through alot of challenges and trials.

                              I spend my first year to fourth year of elementary at STEP Learning Academy. It was a small school with a population of 100+. I learned to meet new people during my stay there and I consider my experience over there as a cornerstone in my life today. I eventually transfered to Saint Louis School Center during my fifth year of elementary because I want to meet new people and at that time the atmosphere at STEP Learning Academy was becoming dull and I wasn't studying enough. During my grade 5 to grade 6 year, I learned to be self-dependent of myself in studying and in finding the necessary resources be cause my mom flew to Saudi Arabia to work there as a dentist.

                          <p id="details">
                              I spend my whole highschool life in Saint Louis University Laboratory High School where I discovered my talents and tons of people. What I used to be during my elementary days changed and what the other half of life right now started from highschool. I started to socialize more where I hang out with loads of people after school and during saturdays. During my first year, it was really a challenge for me to understand some of my classmate's attitude because it makes me uncomfortable but soon to find out that I became friends with them. On my send to third year, this was the time that I got involved with petty beefs that when I look back at it I just laugh at it. On my last year of highschool, I started to become serious so I can participate on the graduation rites. Eventually I finished my highschool on the year 2014 and honestly highschool was really a preparation for me my next chapter in life, college.

                              Currently I am a third year Bachelor of Science in Information Techonology in Saint Louis University doing my best to work hard every single day. At this current time I've met people from all sorts of backgrounds and get to know what there customs and their culture is like. For me this is the best part of my academic life because I've experienced so much fun especially with the new lesson that I've come across with.

                          <p id="details">
                              Music is what motivates me to wake up in the morning and to my best accomplish anything. I've been creating music since the age of 15 using a digital audio workstation called FL Stduio. I've created numerous beats and melodies by posting them on SoundCLoud. My musical inspiration  would have to be Erykah Badu, J-Dilla,  Nujabes, Kendrick Lamar, and Rage Against the Machine just to name a few.

                              Staying up late with your friends in completing the requirements does help grow our relationship with each other. I've managed to make a group be successful in presenting because of our overnights and also I've seen their talents of what they are capable of bringing to the table.
